Vampire bats are up next. The mothers suck the blood out of other animals, such as cows, and then
bring the blood back for the kids. They are social animals and will feed others' offspring as well.
Research has been done in which mother vampire bats were captured and had their blood sacs filled
with air so that it would appear to the other bats that they had a lot of good blood to share. When
they returned to the nest and did not share, others took note and were then didn't help the
research bat's offspring the next time they returned with blood food.

Stickleback fish also engage in tit for tat strategies. As does the Black Hamlet Fish, which is also

<h4 id="orge541f37">Behavioral Evolution II</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge541f37">
<p>
Man is not the only species that kills for non-predatory reasons.
</p>

<p>
Infanticide is found within groups of langur monkeys, lions, vervet monkeys, mountain gorillas and
other species as well. Initial attempts were made to dismiss the events as abnormal, with a variety of
reasons to set aside the behavior as psychopathological but not typical of the species.
</p>

<p>
But then biologists began noticing patterns. It tends to be adult males doing the killing. The actions are not random; the
infants are the offspring of other males. It's a competitive strategy that reduces the other guy's
reproductive success while improving the killer's since the female no longer has anything to mother
and can now move back into the birthing cycle and have his offspring.
</p>

<p>
There is a formula for this - competitive infanticide occurs when the time between births by the
mother is shorter than the average reign for the top male. So the competitive infanticide is there to
ensure that he doesn't miss out on the chance to breed with the female when she's busy rearing her
offspring instead of mating with him. 
</p>

<p>
The most striking example of how this demonstrates that animals do not operate for the good of the
group is that of mountain gorillas. Their numbers are dwindling with approximately 600-700 out
there in the wild but they continue to kill their own despite it being against their best interests.
</p>

<p>
It is, however, highly unlikely that Ishmael would engage in this foolish behavior&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
However, when the male replaces a relative, the infanticide is checked by the element of kinship
selection and the evolved behavior of supporting, not destroying, the success of relatives. 
</p>

<p>
Females have developed responses to the infanticide. They may spontaneously abort the fetus
(rodents), miscarry after being harassed by the new male (wild horses) or even go into pseudo-estrus
in which they give off all the signs and even mate with the new guy but without actually giving up the
original fetus. 
</p>

<p>
Females will also physically defend their offspring, with the most menacing being the maternal
grandmother who has past her prime but still has a genetic stake in the matter. The mother will
defend, but not to the point of serious injury. As she ages, her defense will be more vigorous. (Of
course these are general patterns and an aggressive male is not guaranteed that things will turn out
well for him.)
</p>

<p>
Kidnapping among savannah baboons is more likely to be seen when the aggressive, high ranking
male has been in the troop for a while than when he hasn't since some other baboon's offspring
doesn't make a compelling shield. 
</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org7178593"></a>Dominance hierarchies<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org7178593">
<p>
In essence, having males is
a "risky strategy" in a tournament species because 5% of the males get to produce 95% of the future
offspring, so the odds are that a male will not get to mate well. Females tend to mate regardless, so
having a female will tend to carry the genes onward at a higher rate. Thus higher ranking females
show a greater tendency to give birth to males while lower ranking females have a greater tendency
to give birth to females. This is not a choice, but rather reflects some gradual adaptation that's
resulted from the males of top ranking females getting to pass on their genes while the lower
ranking females' male offspring did not but their daughters did. However, dominance among the
males is not based on nepotism, it's based on strength and power, so a male can ascend if he's able
to. And the male offspring of a top ranking female may be entirely unsuccessful. My sense is that
there isn't a lot to be gained from this section as it's speculative and, of course, the females aren't
really choosing to have a male or a female baby; there's simply some tendency that has enabled the
offspring of top ranking male-female combinations to be more likely to produce a male. This notion
leads into an upcoming topic, which is intersexual competition.
</p>

<p>
The bias toward more females during times of ecological duress connects directly to the metabolic
demands of males being higher than the metabolic demands of females. The tougher it is on the
mother, the greater the odds of the fetus not surviving. 
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org2e648ec"></a>Intersexual competition<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org2e648ec">
<p>
Intersexual competition reflects differing interests in the future reproductive success of the female.
In tournament species in which the males migrate, they care little about what happens to the female
once they are gone and so aggressive elements are sometimes found within their sperm. These
elements help increase the odds of generating a successful pregnancy and set the fetus up to be
more metabolically demanding. Females, on the other hand, have evolved ways to neutralize these
elements as they are costly and dangerous. 
</p>

<p>
Imprinted genes are genes that have different manifestations depending on which parent they came
from. In classic Mendelian genetics, a combination of Aa and AA treats the A's as similar, but with
imprinted genes it actually matters whether the A came from the father or mother because the gene
will behave differently. Through the process of methylization, the gene's behavior will be altered
based on its origin. If you get it from one parent it will be active, if from the other it will be silenced.
When you look at imprinted genes that are active if they come from the father, they all tend to be
genes that promote fetal growth. If from the mother, they tend to slow down fetal growth. For
example, one of the genes codes for insulin like growth factor. Not hard to see how that fits in. The
female's version makes for a less responsive receptor for the insulin like growth factor. Another
example is choriocarcinoma, which is a cancer of the uterus that can happen if the male's sperm has
aggressive growth factors and the female has no counterbalancing genes; this leads to unchecked
growth which is bad. Pregnancy hyperglycemia is another example as the fetus is trying to get lots of
sugar from mom but mom may have an active gene that checks that (hypoglycemia will occur if she
does not). These types of imprinted genes are not typically seen in pair bonding species. Humans are
again right in the middle. 
</p>

<p>
Next up is the fun topic of&#x2026;sperm competition? Yes, research into fruit flies shows that another
strategy that's out there is the sperm carrying a toxin that kills off other males' sperm. Sadly for the
females, the toxins are also potentially toxic to them. Thus we see females have evolved ways to
counteract this. 
</p>

<p>
Exogamy impacts the behavior of animals as well. There is variation in who leaves (females in chimps
and gorillas, males in baboon troops) and that influences what happens within the group. For
example, chimp groups can be highly aggressive and even genocidal toward other groups
("outsiders" or "them") because the males are all related by kinship ties and thus get along much
better than they would if there was male exogamy.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org004768f"></a>Group selection<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org004768f">
<p>
One of the scariest things in the world is when all the males in a given group start getting along
really well with each other. Aggression toward the others often follows. 
</p>

<p>
This relates to military techniques that aim to create a sense of kinship among the troops. This makes
them a band of brothers that will cooperate with each other, though it can have divisive effects as
well, such as was seen in the Vietnam War, because the group may agree to disagree with orders and
commands from above, the hierarchical other.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Founder Effect
A bio-geographic (or other) event occurs that separates out a subset from a larger group. This
smaller subset soon becomes more inbred than the larger whole, simply as a by-product of being a
smaller group. This translates into having a higher degree of relatedness, which introduces the
whole business of kin selection. Because these guys are more closely related, they will work together
more as a group and will end up outcompeting the original group members when they are reunited.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Another scenario is demonstrated through the example of two chickens, one that's highly aggressive
and one that's more laid back. When competing one on one, the more aggressive chicken will lay
more eggs, but there's the drawback in which a group of aggressive chickens will harass each other
and thus impair their own breeding while the calmer group will lay more eggs because as a group
they cause less grief for each other.

<div id="outline-container-orgb1bc9ff" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb1bc9ff">Criticisms</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb1bc9ff">
<p>
The first criticism rests on the notion of heritability and the associated notion that the behaviors are
genetically received, inevitable and produced. The next notion is that of adaptiveness, which
suggests that all behaviors have evolved because they are adaptive (beneficial). The third principle is
that the changes are gradual. 
</p>

<p>
The molecular view challenges the notion of heritability. While the evolutionary biologist argues that
the trait is commonly seen among groups and has emerged because it is inherited and beneficial, the
molecular folks say show me the gene, establish the direct connection.
</p>

<p>
Adaptiveness is attacked as the adaptationist fallacy. Everything is reduced down to a just so story in
which the best story wins. He notes that to honestly assess it, you must keep the context in mind.
Squid aren't so great as swimmers compared to fish, but they kick butt compared to mollusks, which
is where they started. Nevertheless we have the concept of spandrels (courtesy of Stephen Jay Gould
and Richard Lewontin), suggesting that some evolved elements just came along for the ride. 
</p>

<p>
These spandrels would be decorated, but for all that they weren't put there for adaptive purposes.
They are simply inevitable when arches are brought together. As Francois Jacob put it "Evolution is a
tinkerer." 
</p>

<p>
The theory is heavily saturated with elements of competition and outcompeting the others at every
level, with the winner being, by definition, the best and most worthy and most fit. All of this fits in
with rather nicely with the world view and SES of the people advancing these arguments, each of
whom was a Southern white male. 
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, competition may not be the most important element. Russian biologists viewed
the issue from a collective viewpoint and had a greater respect for the impact of external elements,
such as the environment. 
</p>

<p>
Gould and others suggested that gradualism was possibly a flawed concept. Instead they suggested
that punctuated equilibrium makes more sense. In this scenario, most of the time nothing is
happening and there isn't really much impact from all this competition stuff. Then a genetic change
of some sort occurs and a massive change follows and then things return back to normal.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org47dbb24"></a>Politics<br />

<p>
Politics comes into play as well, with issues ranging from male domination, sexual aggression, social
stratification and more and the question of the extent to which these are a reflection of natural
order. 
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the gradualists were Northeastern Marxists. And the world they want it to be fits
smoothly into the notion of dialectical materialism.

<p>
Genes as molecules, genes as information, genes as DNA. Here we have proteins emerging for their
importance in the structure of cells and cellular activity. Proteins hold the shapes of cells together,
they form messengers and hormones, they are the enzymes that do all kinds of important stuff;
proteins are the workhorses.
</p>

<p>
So what codes for proteins? This is where genes come in. Genes specify (code for) proteins. Proteins
are built from amino acids, of which there are approximately 20 that commonly occur. Each one has
to be coded for with a different DNA sequence, a different DNA sequence of 3 letters (3 nucleotides).
He notes that in the process DNA first specifies a code string of RNA which then specifies the protein
construction (amino acid string). Thus if you know the DNA then you will know the RNA which in turn
gives you a sense of the amino acids which will form the protein and knowing that informs you of the
shape of the protein (different amino acids vary in their attraction toward water and these levels
influence the ultimate shape) which clues you in on the function of the protein. That is the critical link
from the DNA to the function and the notion of a behavior being genetically controlled. 
</p>

<p>
Proteins fit into other molecules like a LOCK and KEY! This is the whole world of hormones and
neurotransmitters fitting into their particular receptors. 
</p>

<p>
He notes that prion diseases are an exception to the hydrophobic/hydrophilic structure of proteins. 
</p>

<p>
Enzymes are important because they catalyze reactions. That is they cause reactions to occur which
on their own would be unlikely to happen. A simple way of looking at this is to think of it as bringing
things together or separating them, as appropriate. Virtually every enzyme is a protein. This affects
cellular activity by influencing the opening and closing of ion channels. Ion channels connect directly
with the cell's decision to act or not. 
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org08277ac"></a>Central Dogma<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org08277ac">
<p>
Francis Crick is credited with establishing a central dogma of genetics - DNA codes for RNA which
codes for proteins. Sapolsky focuses the listener on a subtle element of this dogma, which is that DNA
is ultimately in charge, sitting around and deciding what will happen and when, and then releasing
the instructions that become the RNA to protein chain. Surprisingly, DNA isn't always in charge.
Viruses are mentioned as an example. Viruses are basically snippets of DNA that get into a living
organism and hijack its DNA, taking over the plane and directing where it goes, making it function for
the virus's desire. In the 1970's viruses made of RNA were discovered. The pathway is facilitated by
enzymes which convert the RNA into DNA and start up the whole parasitic process. Accordingly, these
are called retroviruses because they are reverting from RNA back to DNA. 
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orge698eba"></a>Mutations<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orge698eba">
<p>
Mutations are important because they can alter the orders from DNA. A micromutation occurs when
one letter within the DNA sequence is accidentally miscopied. Pairs of triplets (amino acids) are coded
for by the DNA. This is a connection of three base pairs. So we can have a change in one of these
letters which may impact the ultimate shape and function of the amino acid that is created.
</p>

<p>
There are three basic types of alterations. First is a point mutation, which consists of one of the
letters being changed into a different letter. This may not matter because of the limited number of
different amino acid combinations. There are four different letters (nucleotides) and three letters
needed, so we get 4x4x4 or 64 different potential combinations, but there are only about 20 amino
acid shapes, so there's overlap in that shape 22 GAU may be similar to shape 43 GTU, so the change
from A to T may not significantly change the shape (please note that this example is an example for
understanding and is not based on a specific shape 22 or 43). 
</p>

<p>
For example: "I cdnuolt blveiee taht I cluod aulaclty uesdnatnrd waht I was rdanieg. The phaonmneal

</p>

<p>
Changes in the 1st or 3rd nucleotide (letter) may also be of minimal significance as the amino acids
have similar shapes so a minor letter change may only result in a minor shape change that produce
a minor change in results but does not dramatically change the functioning of the amino acid.

I will now do this.

<p>
However, there can also be a point deletion. This consists of a nucleotide being deleted. In classical
genetics a deletion mutation has dramatic effects and is a big deal.

<p>
The third type is insertion mutation.

Deletion and insertion mutations tend to have big consequences.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgf618805">
<p>
The takeaway is that these mutations change how well the protein does its job. For example, there's
a chemical in the body called phenylalanine which has its uses but if it builds up to a high level it
becomes toxic to brain cells and results in mental retardation, brain damage and seizures. There's an
enzyme (made of proteins) that converts it into something safer. Now the scenario is that you have a
mutation in the gene that codes for that enzyme. As a result of a micromutation, the enzyme no
longer does its job. The phenylalanine then builds up in the body and creates the disastrous effects
noted above, laying waste to one's nervous system. This is Phenylketonuria (PKU) disorder. This is
not a minor change; it will rapidly destroy the person's nervous system.

<li><a id="orgf26783c"></a>Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgf26783c">
<p>
Another example involves a hormone being changed by a mutation. Imagine a daughter that is not
hitting puberty when her other classmates do. At 10-11 some are experiencing changes but not her.
She continues to age and does not reach puberty. Since she's falling behind you take her in to see the
doctor. Eventually the doctor is going to sit you down and explain that the reason why your daughter
has not started menstruating is that you don't have a daughter; you have a son. This kid suffers from
TFM, testicular feminization syndrome (also known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome). At the
chromosome level, they are male (XY not XX). They have testes, but they never dropped or developed
normally outside the body. The testes make testosterone. Nevertheless, you get a female phenotype
with female external genitalia. This results from a mutation that changes the shape of the androgen
(testosterone) receptor, making it insensitive to the androgen's attempted effects.

</li>
<li><a id="org6847ce7"></a>sex change<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org6847ce7">
<p>
Another example relates to a disease found among two populations - one up in the mountains in the
Dominican Republic and the other population in the mountains in Papa New Guinea. In this disease
there's a problem with the enzymes that make testosterone. So what happens is that there's very
little testosterone having any influence - the levels are too low to take effect. So the kid is
phenotypically female with female external genitalia. Next when puberty hits the brain tells the body
to start producing testosterone. The body does so and while the levels don't go up as much as they
would in a normal male because of the enzyme, they go up enough. And the poor kid switches sex.

He mentions benzodiazepines (synthetic) are up next. He mentions that differences in the amino
acids will subtly impact how these guys fit into their receptors which will in turn impact the
individual's level of anxiety. This example points to the variance among people that minor
differences in genes can create.
</p>

<p>
He transitions into brief comments about rats that were bred to be high or low anxiety and then
notes that this moves us away from "them and their disease." This foreshadows the lecture on
individual differences, a lecture that is surely among the best psychology lectures ever as Sapolsky
brings a startlingly, empathic and eye opening perspective to the issue of individual differences and
makes it crystal clear why it isn't "them and their disease." (Watching that lecture and his discussion
on depression will place you ahead of 95% of the population in understanding individual differences
and psychological problems. Sapolsky simply rocks.)

<li><a id="orgd79dacb"></a>FoxP2<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgd79dacb">
<p>
Foxp2 has something to do with language. The discovery began with a family that displayed a
mutation in the Foxp2 gene and had a language anomaly of some sort (motoric or symbolic - that
was the debate). This is potentially significant because versions of Foxp2 occur throughout the
animal kingdom. Birds, rats, apes, people&#x2026;and in all these places it has something to do with
communication. Curiously the differences are small until you get to humans and there we see a
whole bunch of changes when compared to other members of the animal kingdom. So the major
difference in language capability may be the result of continual evolutionary change in the base
pairs of the Foxp2 gene. 
</p>

<p>
An experiment was done a few years ago with mice in which they knocked out the mouse version of
Foxp2 and substituted the human version. The mice began to demonstrate more complex language
expressions.

<li><a id="orgc8a5e87"></a>Positive and Negative Selection<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgc8a5e87">
<p>
Ok, so there are 64 possible combinations that code for 20 amino acids. Say you look at a mutation
and 40 of the combinations have no impact. In this case we have a standard mutation rate with
2/3rds of the changes not impacting the formation of the amino acid and 1/3rd changing it. Contrast
this with a scenario in which you examine a mutation and find that 99% of the differences in the base
pairs will impact the amino acid's formation. This is an echo of a very strong advantage or adaptation
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>there would have been positive selection for this trait. It's not general variation or just hanging</li>
</ul>
<p>
around; it's been picked. 
</p>

<p>
Alternatively if 99% of the mutations have no immediate impact this is a stabilizing gene in which you
do not want to mess with its function (it's strongly set against any kind of change, which indicates
that change is really bad in this area).
</p>

<p>
The changes in Foxp2 are positive changes.
</p>

<p>
Ok, so here's the idea. If 99% of the changes impact the amino acid then we have positive selection.
If 99% don't, then we have negative selection. It works this way because the positive elements can
build on each other and changes in it can be beneficial while impairments aren't devastating (for
example, do any of us write like Marcel Proust? No, but we can still express ourselves poetically).
However, when 99% of mutations have no impact, it's a highly stabilized gene. For example, do any
of us have no lungs?

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org4336c00">
<p>
Next up is the whole sibling chimpanzee percentage topic. You share 50% of your genes with a
sibling, but you share 98% of your genes with chimpanzee. What? This is about the level we look at.
For example, chimps and humans have noses, so that's a commonality when compared to a tree,
which only has a nose when it's in "The Lord of the Rings" or wandering around Stanford. However,
humans can have button noses, aristocratic noses, etc. which is a DNA difference but at a much more
specific level.

<li><a id="orgc960438"></a>Punctuated equilibrium<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgc960438">
<p>
The carryover to the political element is that if every bit of the advantage or disadvantage that comes
from a mutation matters then it follows that every bit of competition (competitive advantage) also
matters. 
</p>

<p>
In the 1980's Stephen J. Gould, a paleontologist, and Niles Eldredge, also a paleontologist, came up
with a very different model. They challenged the gradualist model, arguing that instead there are
long periods of stasis where nothing happens and that the little changes don't matter much. Instead
when change happens it's rapid and dramatic. This is known as punctuated equilibrium. Gould was a
Marxist, though, so it's worth noting that this model fits in with the dialectic process (thesis -
equilibrium; antithesis - mutation; synthesis - new beings). Analyzing the fossil records shows long
periods where nothing seems to change and then suddenly there's a big change followed by long
periods where nothing's happening. This implies that the vast majority of the small changes aren't
that important and that the competition framework is incorrect and serves mostly to create an
illusion that nature has a massive hierarchy that's determined by competition when in reality nature
permits most varieties to do just fine, thank you. Continuing with the political theme, it's then noted
that it's mighty convenient that the competitive model fits in nicely with the environment that its
advocates come from and have benefited from. 
</p>

<p>
The first counter is that these are very different disciplines - what counts as rapid for a
paleontologist isn't really fast. 100,000 years isn't all that quick (and changes that occur a little bit at a
time due to competition over 100,000 years could appear rapid based on the starting point while
still being driven by each minor advantage the whole time). 
</p>

<p>
The next counter is that flesh and tissue do not leave a record in the paleontological record. A fossil
won't tell you what happened inside the brain (in the sense that minor advantages won't necessarily
manifest physically; anyone reading this likely has intellectual advantages over the vast majority of
your peers but is unlikely to have a gigantic elephant head that holds a bigger, stronger brain. It's
all the same from the outside.) All paleontology can study is forms, morphology.
</p>

<p>
The third challenge comes from molecular biologists who ask for the actual genes and evolutionary
mechanism that would create this pattern.
</p>

<p>
Sapolsky notes that when the last challenge was brought up in the 1980's the paleontologists didn't
have a good, evidence-based rejoinder, but that a lot of the stuff that's happened since then has
supported the notion of punctuated equilibrium.

<li><a id="org6cb14ae"></a>Non coding DNA and and instruction manual<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6cb14ae">
<p>
Next he moves onto DNA. When we look at a DNA strand, there are periods that code for genes
interspliced with large sections (95% or so is non-coding) that function as an "instruction manual."
The genes themselves are not always coded for in just one snippet. Often multiple areas on the DNA
will code for parts of the same gene. So you can have a section that codes for the first third of a
protein followed by a long stretch that has nothing to do with that protein. This is then followed by a
section coding for the next third. And so on. Each of these sections is called an exon. The in-between
stuff is called introns. People deduced and then discovered something called splicing enzymes. 
</p>

<p>
The splicing enzymes would come along and snip out the intron section so that the first third of the
exon connected to the middle third and the final third to produce a clear read-out. 
</p>

<p>
David Baltimore was the first to introduce the concept that this makes the genes modular and opens
the door to massive information within the DNA universe. Because of this flexibility, DNA would then
have the potential to abandon the original A-B-C model and create, for example, an A-C combination.
This will give you 7 different ways to combine these exons, which means there are 7 different
proteins that can result (pacing mutations of course). 
</p>

<p>
This is a massive deviation from the concept that one gene specifies one protein. Different splicing
enzymes can thus create very different results. The more they are researched, the more flexibility
emerges - different enzymes, splicing at different spots. So we have different items being created by
the same basic DNA original set due to different splicing enzymes being activated and activated at
different times of life (think Mr. Potato head as DNA and a child as the splicing enzymes - same basic
pieces, lots of possibilities). 
</p>

<p>
The instruction booklet part of DNA is all about when and under what circumstances to activate and
start and stop creating proteins. (For example, human growth hormone is released throughout life
but has peak periods.) For better or worse this means that DNA doesn't "know" what it's doing.
Instead it's a read-out that's under the control of lots of other factors. Among these are the
regulatory sequences upstream from the gene. These might be called promoter or repressive
sequences that promote or repress the expression of DNA snippets downstream. They are like
switches. And they are turned on when the right event (internal or external) happens. These events
are triggered by transcription factors. These might turn on single genes or whole networks in the
DNA. On the flipside, any given gene can have a whole bunch of different promoters that it's waiting
to hear from before it does its thing. 
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orga1f0690"></a>Environment and transcription factor<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orga1f0690">
<p>
So who's in charge? Whoever or whatever controls those transcription factors. Including the
environment. Which has something to do with genetic effects (shocker!)
</p>

<p>
So what qualifies as environment?
</p>

<p>
It could be something within the cell. For example maybe the cell
is getting low on energy. This could release a transcription factor that would result in the cell being
activated to take up more energy. 
</p>

<p>
Or it could be something from outside the cell, such as a hormone floating around in the
bloodstream. A hormone is a blood borne chemical messenger. Testosterone is used as an example.
It would float far and wide and have its effects and those effects would increase significantly when
the male hits puberty resulting in changes in lots of areas in the body. 
</p>

<p>
You could have a messenger from the outside environment, such as a scary sight or an olfactory
messenger, like a pheromone.
</p>

<p>
As a consequence of this, Sapolsky notes that the most interesting stuff with DNA now is not the
specific nature of the proteins but rather when it does its thing and what elements trigger it. 
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org7dbd7e3"></a>Chromatin and epigenetics<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org7dbd7e3">
<p>
DNA is covered, stabilized and protected by chromatin. And so there is a whole world of messengers
that inform the chromatin of where and when to open up and allow the transcription factors
through. Changes can also happen that will permanently impact the chromatin. For example,
mothering styles in rats have been shown to permanently change elements in the chromatin in areas
relating to anxiety. This leads into the field of epigenetics. Research with monkeys has shown a
change in one area impacting 4,000 other areas!
</p>

<p>
So fertilization is all about genetics while development is all about epigenetics. 
</p>

<p>
So if we have a mutation in one of these splicing enzymes or transcription factors, the kind of
changes that would result could well fit into the punctuated equilibrium (not gradual) model of
evolution.
